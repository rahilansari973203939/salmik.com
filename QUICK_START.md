## ⚠️ Known Issues & Notes

### 1. Browser localStorage

- If cart clears, check if localStorage is enabled
- Incognito mode doesn't persist data
- Clear DevTools → Application → Cookies/Storage to reset

### 2. Images

- Current images are placeholders
- Replace with actual product images in `public/images/`
- Update image paths in `src/data/products.json`

### 3. Authentication

- Currently uses localStorage (client-side only)
- For production, implement JWT backend
- Mock OTP flow ready for real SMS service

### 4. Payment

- Currently mock only
- Razorpay button ready for integration
- Update checkout page with real Razorpay SDK
